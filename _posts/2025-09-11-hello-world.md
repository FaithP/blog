This is my first post on the new blog! 

I'm setting up a Jekyll-powered blog to share insights about consulting, leadership, and technology. This replaces my previous blog setup and gives me more control over the content and presentation.

## What to expect

I'll be writing about:
- Business strategy and operations
- Leadership lessons from the field
- Technology insights and tools
- Case studies from consulting work

## Technical setup

This blog is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages, giving me:
- Version control for all content
- Markdown writing workflow
- Automatic deployment
- Custom domain support

Looking forward to sharing more insights here!
