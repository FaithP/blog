Stumbled over this feature. Why I like it:
* I can easily see what needs my attention right away.
* I can choose panel contents rather than let GMail choose for me.
* Example: `in:unreads -category:promotions`<!--more-->

To try it go to Gmail Settings > See all settings > Inbox tab > Inbox type > Multiple Inboxes.

* Custom Inbox queries can use any GMail search/filter syntax. ([Refine Searches in GMail](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?sjid=13244926240803494100-NA#)) For example, I could create an inbox to see emails from Mom :-). 
* "Priority Inbox" gives some of the same benefits but is less customizable. ([How to choose the best inbox type for your needs](https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-inbox-types/))
* Feature not available on mobile.
