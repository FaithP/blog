Terry listened as the monthly program review circled back to the same concern. Alex's project - six months in, nothing to show, timeline slipping. One executive wondered aloud whether they needed "different project leadership." Terry had seen this pattern before: good people trapped in a broken approach, about to become casualties of their own system. "Give me two weeks to assess the situation," Terry said. "Before we make personnel changes."

Terry had been watching Alex's team for weeks - talented people producing detailed documentation while their stakeholders grew increasingly restless. Alex seemed capable but trapped in a dynamic that demanded impossible things: predict the unpredictable, build everything perfectly on the first try, deliver complex software without learning what users actually needed. Terry spotted Alex heading to the break room and quietly asked Sam to update the project board in the hallway. Sometimes people needed to see a different way working before they could imagine it for themselves.

The introduction came exactly as Terry had hoped - Alex curious, a little desperate, asking the right questions. "Terry's helped a bunch of teams figure this out," Sam had said, and Terry could see Alex's relief at discovering this wasn't just Sam's natural genius. When they met the next day, Terry resisted the urge to diagnose everything wrong with Alex's approach. Instead, they asked simple questions: "What would prove to your stakeholders that this is heading in the right direction? What's the smallest thing you could build that would give everyone confidence?" Terry watched Alex's face change as they realized they'd been planning to serve a seven-course meal when everyone was starving for a sandwich.

Two weeks later, Terry sat in the back of Alex's first demo, watching magic happen. Alex clicked through their basic dashboard - rough around the edges but undeniably real - while stakeholders leaned forward and started asking different questions. Not "when will everything be done?" but "could we also see data from the regional offices?" The energy in the room had shifted from defensive to generative. Alex was fielding suggestions with confidence, explaining what they'd prioritize next and why. Terry barely spoke during the hour-long session. They didn't need to. Alex had discovered what Terry already knew: nothing builds trust like working software and thoughtful decisions made together.

Three months later, the monthly program review barely mentioned Alex's project - except to note it as the template other teams should follow. Alex had become the stakeholder Terry wished every project had: engaged without being controlling, decisive without being rigid, celebrating each increment while keeping eyes on the bigger vision. Terry's assessment had turned into ongoing coaching, but most weeks Alex didn't need it. They'd internalized the rhythm of building trust through small, frequent wins. Terry smiled, watching Alex explain to another struggling project lead how working software changed everything. The best interventions made themselves invisible.Terry's Story - The Facilitator Who Knew How to Wait
