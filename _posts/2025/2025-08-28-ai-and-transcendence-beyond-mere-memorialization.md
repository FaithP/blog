The other day I asked "[Do We Envy AI?](https://faithpeterson.writeas.com/do-we-envy-ai)" Does "AI" seem to possess some kinds of transcendence that we aspire to but can't or haven't reached?  Today, the inverse: using LLMs and related technologies to create representations of ourselves that survive our deaths. Welcome Lucy AI, an art installation/exhibit that was explicitly created in response to Lucy Simic's stage 4 cancer diagnosis.
